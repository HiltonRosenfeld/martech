# 20250401 Schema Updates

## ProfileCap

As discussed on the call today we can replace the profilecap_week and profilecap_day tables with a single table. This is because the number of messages per client_id is very small. The proposed replacement table design is given below. In addition, we discussed the amount of precision required for the comm_time column in the channel level tables. Further details about the outcome for each discussion are given below. We can discuss next week the approach to handle the corner case of a missing day during the daily to weekly table data cutover, and / or any of the information given below.

### Replacement table for profilecap_week and profilecap_day

This table will store the number of messages sent on every day in a given year for a given customer, channel, and month.

The number of messages sent per day per customer channel is assumed to be less than 100. In this table we store the id of each message, rather than the time the message was sent. Unlike the messages per channel tables, no offsets need to be stored, and thus there is no need to store the time each message was sent.

```cql
CREATE TABLE profilecap_month (
    customer_id uuid,
    channel text,
    comm_month int,
    comm_day int,
    communication_id uuid,
    PRIMARY KEY ((customer_id, channel, comm_month), comm_day, communication_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (comm_day DESC) AND default_time_to_live = 15552000;
```

#### Columns

- customer_id: the idea of a customer; this design assumes a uuid for its data type.
- channel: the channel the daily messages are associated with.
- comm_month: the month a message is sent to the client channel in the format YYYYMM.
- comm_day: the day in the month a message is sent to the client channel in the format DD.
- message_id: the unique id of the message; this design assumes a uuid for its data type.

### Usage

Use the following statement to get all the channel messages sent for a single user for a particular date:

```cql
SELECT message_id
FROM profilecap_month
WHERE customer_id = <id>
    AND channel = '<channel>'
    AND comm_month = <month>
    AND comm_day = <day>;
```

In the above query, the desired date consists of the `month` and `day` values.

Use the following statements to get all the channel messages for a single user for the last 30 days.

```cql
SELECT message_id
FROM profilecap_month
WHERE customer_id = <id>
    AND channel = '<channel>'
    AND comm_month = <current_month>
    AND comm_day <= <current_day>;

SELECT message_id
FROM profilecap_month
WHERE customer_id = <id>
    AND channel = '<channel>'
    AND comm_month = <previous_month>
    AND comm_day >= <days_in_previous_month - (30 - <current_day>)>;
```

First of the above two queries will retrieve all the channel messages for a single user in the current month up to the current day. If the current day is less than 30, the remaining days can be retrieved using the second query. This query will retrieve all the channel messages for a single user in the previous month for the remaining days required to make a 30 day period.
